# CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced CI/CD pipeline with security scanning, code coverage, performance benchmarks, and deployment automation.

## Features

### Security Scanning
- **Trivy**: Filesystem vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability detection
- **RustSec**: Rust security audit
- **npm audit**: JavaScript dependency audit
- Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### Code Coverage
- **Rust**: Using `cargo-tarpaulin` for coverage reporting
- **Frontend**: Jest coverage reports
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
- Minimum coverage thresholds enforced

### Performance Benchmarks
- Rust benchmarks run on every push
- Results tracked over time
- Performance regressions detected
- Benchmarks stored in artifacts

### Deployment Pipeline
- Automated staging deployments on main branch
- Manual production deployments with approval
- Smoke tests after deployment
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Deployment notifications

## Workflow Jobs

### CI Jobs (Pull Requests)
1. **Rust Quality Checks**
   - Format checking
   - Linting with Clippy
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Code coverage
   - WASM build verification
   - Benchmark compilation

2. **Frontend Quality Checks**
   - Format checking
   - ESLint linting
   - TypeScript type checking
   - Production build
   - Coverage reporting

3. **Security Scanning**
   - Trivy filesystem scan
   - RustSec audit
   - npm audit
   - Cargo audit

4. **Dependency Checks**
   - npm production dependencies
   - Rust dependencies

### CD Jobs (Main Branch)
1. **Build Artifacts**
   - Docker image creation
   - Multi-platform builds
   - Registry push

2. **Deploy Staging**
   - Automatic deployment
   - Smoke tests
   - Health checks

3. **Deploy Production**
   - Manual trigger required
   - Approval gates
   - Deployment verification
   - Rollback capability

## Configuration

### Branch Protection Rules
```
Settings > Branches > main
- Require status checks to pass:
  - Rust Quality Checks
  - Frontend Quality Checks
  - Security Scanning
  - Dependency Check
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require code reviews (1 approval)
```

### Secrets Required
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - Codecov integration
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - Slack notifications
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY_TOKEN` - Docker registry access

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- Cargo dependencies cached by lock file
- npm dependencies cached by package-lock.json
- Docker layer caching enabled
- Build artifacts cached

### Parallel Execution
- Rust and Frontend checks run in parallel
- Security scanning runs independently
- Reduces total pipeline time

## Monitoring

### Pipeline Metrics
- Build time trends
- Test pass/fail rates
- Coverage trends
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes

### Alerts
- Failed builds notify team
- Security vulnerabilities trigger alerts
- Coverage drops below threshold
- Deployment failures trigger rollback
