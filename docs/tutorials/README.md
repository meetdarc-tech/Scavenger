# Smart Contract Tutorial Series

Step-by-step tutorials for building, testing, and deploying Soroban smart contracts on the Scavenger platform.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (`rustup` with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target)
- Stellar CLI (`soroban`)
- A funded Stellar testnet account
- Basic understanding of Rust ownership and traits

```bash
# Install Stellar CLI
cargo install --locked stellar-cli --features opt

# Add wasm target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Fund a testnet account
soroban keys generate dev-key
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=$(soroban keys address dev-key)"
```

## How the Tutorials Are Structured

Each tutorial follows a consistent format:

1. **Goal** — what you will build by the end
2. **Concepts** — theory behind the implementation
3. **Step-by-step code** — annotated Rust snippets
4. **Test coverage** — unit and integration tests
5. **Deploy** — CLI commands to deploy on testnet
6. **Checkpoint** — verify your implementation is correct

## Running Tutorial Tests

All tutorial code lives in `stellar-contract/src/`. Run the full test suite with:

```bash
cd stellar-contract
cargo test
```

Run a specific tutorial's tests:

```bash
cargo test tutorial_01
```
