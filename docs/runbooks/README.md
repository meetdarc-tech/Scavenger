## Runbook Standards

Every procedure in this library follows the same format:

1. **Trigger** — when to use this runbook
2. **Prerequisites** — access and tools required
3. **Steps** — numbered, copy-pasteable commands
4. **Verification** — how to confirm success
5. **Rollback** — how to undo the procedure if it goes wrong

---

## Runbook Versioning

Each runbook file carries a version header:

```
Version: 1.x
Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD
Owner: @on-call-team
```

Update the version and `Last updated` date when procedures change. Increment the minor version for non-breaking additions, the major version for procedure rewrites or breaking process changes.

---

## Runbook Search

Use `grep` to find the procedure you need:

```bash
# Find all procedures related to rate limiting
grep -r "rate.limit" docs/runbooks/

# Find all rollback procedures
grep -rn "Rollback" docs/runbooks/

# Find all procedures requiring database access
grep -rn "psql\|postgres" docs/runbooks/
```

---

## Runbook Automation

Procedures marked with `[AUTOMATED]` have a corresponding script in `scripts/runbooks/`. Run them directly:

```bash
# List available automated procedures
ls scripts/runbooks/

# Run the secret rotation procedure
bash scripts/runbooks/rotate-secrets.sh
```

Manual steps within an automated procedure are printed with a `[MANUAL]` prefix.
