# Rate Limiting

The Scavenger backend enforces per-IP rate limits using a **sliding window** algorithm.

## Tiers

| Tier | Requests / minute | Requests / hour |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Anonymous | 30 | 200 |
| Free | 60 | 1 000 |
| Premium | 300 | 5 000 |
| Admin | 1 000 | 50 000 |

The default tier applied to all requests is **Free** unless the middleware is configured with a specific `RateLimitConfig`.

## Response Headers

Every response includes:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit-Minute` | Maximum requests allowed per minute |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit-Hour` | Maximum requests allowed per hour |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute` | Requests remaining in the current minute window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining-Hour` | Requests remaining in the current hour window |
| `Retry-After` | Seconds until the window resets (only on 429 responses) |

## Handling 429 Too Many Requests

When rate limited, the API returns HTTP `429` with a plain-text body. Clients should:

1. Read `Retry-After` to determine when to retry.
2. Implement exponential backoff for repeated 429s.
3. Cache responses where possible to reduce request volume.

## Sliding Window Algorithm

Each request timestamp is stored in an in-memory bucket keyed by `<ip>:<window>`. On every request, timestamps older than the window duration are evicted, and the remaining count is compared against the limit. This avoids the burst problem of fixed-window counters.

For production deployments with multiple instances, replace the in-memory store with a shared Redis-backed implementation (see `indexer/src/rate-limit/rate-limiter.ts` for a Redis reference implementation).
