# Scavngr Glossary and Terminology Guide

## Overview

This glossary defines **all** technical and domain-specific terms used in the Scavngr project.
Terms are organised alphabetically with cross-references to related documentation and source code.

> **How to read this document**
> Entries marked with ⛓ are blockchain/Soroban-specific.
> Entries marked with ♻ are waste-management domain terms.
> Entries marked with 💰 relate to the incentive/reward system.
> Entries marked with 👤 describe participant roles and responsibilities.

---

## A

**Admin** 👤  
The contract administrator with elevated privileges. Admins may initialise the contract, manage
system settings, set reward percentages, configure expiry TTLs, manage incentives, run cleanup
jobs, and perform emergency operations. The admin address list is stored on-chain and can be
extended by calling `add_admin`. See: [Participant Quick Reference](./PARTICIPANT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md#admin-operations)

**Acceptance Criteria**  
Specific, testable conditions that must be satisfied for a feature or task to be considered
complete. Used in issue tracking and pull-request reviews.

**Auction** ⛓  
A time-limited bidding mechanism for waste items. Collectors and manufacturers can place bids
on listed waste; the auction ends at a configured `end_time`. Bids must exceed the current bid
by at least 5 %. See: `Auction` struct in `stellar-contract/src/types.rs`.

---

## B

**Batch Operations**  
Processing multiple items (waste, materials, transfers) in a single contract invocation to reduce
transaction fees and ledger storage overhead. See: `batch_transfer_waste` in the contract.

**Beginner** 👤  
The lowest `CertificationLevel` (0–10 wastes processed). Earns a 1.0× reward multiplier.
See: [Certification Levels](#certification-level).

**Blockchain** ⛓  
The Stellar network's distributed ledger on which the Scavngr smart contract is deployed.
Each transaction is recorded immutably and visible to all participants.

**Budget** 💰  
The maximum number of reward tokens allocated to an incentive. Once `remaining_budget` reaches
zero the incentive auto-deactivates. See: [Incentive Terminology](#incentive).

---

## C

**Carbon Credits** ♻ 💰  
Computed metric (in grams of CO₂ equivalent) awarded per gram of waste recycled.
Formula: `credits = weight_grams × carbon_credit_rate_milli / 1000`.
Rates by type (gCO₂e/g): Paper 1.8, Plastic/PetPlastic 2.5, Metal 3.2, Glass 0.8, Organic 0.5,
Electronic 4.0.  
See: `calculate_carbon_credits` in `types.rs`.

**Certification Level** 👤  
A four-tier achievement badge assigned to participants based on their lifetime waste submission
count. Affects reward multipliers:

| Level        | Waste Count | Multiplier |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Beginner     | 0–10        | 1.0×       |
| Intermediate | 11–50       | 1.1×       |
| Advanced     | 51–200      | 1.25×      |
| Expert       | 201+        | 1.5×       |

**Charity Contract** ⛓  
A Stellar account or smart contract designated by the admin to receive platform donations.
Participants can donate earned tokens to the charity address. See: `set_charity_contract`.

**Challenge** 💰  
A time-limited recycling target (weight + waste type) created by an admin, with a bonus reward
for participants who reach the `target_weight` within the `start_time`–`end_time` window.
See: `Challenge` / `ChallengeProgress` types.

**Cleanup Job** ⛓  
The `cleanup_expired_wastes` admin function that iterates all active waste items, deactivates
expired ones, and emits a `WasteExpired` event per item. Should be called periodically
(e.g. via off-chain scheduler). See: [Expiration System](./WASTE_STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

**Collector** 👤  
A participant role that collects waste from Recyclers and transports it to Manufacturers.
Collectors may:
- Transfer waste they own
- Confirm waste submitted by Recyclers
- Grade waste quality (A–D)
- Create collection routes

Valid transfer routes: Recycler → Collector, Collector → Manufacturer.
See: [Participant Roles](./PARTICIPANT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md#roles)

**Confirmation** ♻  
The on-chain verification step in which a second participant (not the waste owner) certifies
that a waste item's details are correct. Confirmed waste is eligible for incentive reward claims.
See: `confirm_waste_details`.

**Contract** ⛓  
The Scavngr Soroban smart contract, written in Rust and deployed as a WASM binary on the
Stellar blockchain. Entry point: `stellar-contract/src/lib.rs`.

**Contamination** ♻  
The presence of non-recyclable or hazardous material mixed with otherwise recyclable waste.
Tracked via `is_contaminated`, `contamination_level` (0–100), and `contamination_reason` on
the `Waste` struct.

---

## D

**Deactivation** ♻  
Permanently marking a waste item as inactive (`is_active = false`), preventing further
transfers, confirmations, or grading. Triggered manually by the owner/admin or automatically
by `cleanup_expired_wastes`.

**Deregistration** 👤  
Removing a participant from the platform via `deregister_participant`. Deregistered participants
cannot submit or transfer waste.

**Document Hash** ⛓  
An IPFS CID (content identifier) for a supporting document (e.g. certificate of recycling).
Up to 5 document hashes may be attached to a single waste item.

---

## E

**E2E Testing**  
End-to-End testing that validates complete user workflows from the frontend through the Stellar
blockchain. See: [E2E Testing Suite](./E2E_TESTING.md)

**Electronic Waste** ♻  
Waste type `Electronic` (discriminant 6). Includes computers, mobile phones, batteries, and
other consumer electronics. Earns the highest carbon credit rate (4.0 gCO₂e/g) and requires
a minimum quality grade of **B** due to safety and data-destruction requirements.

**Event** ⛓  
A Soroban contract event emitted to the ledger log when an important state change occurs.
Key events include:
`WasteRegistered`, `WasteTransferred`, `WasteExpired`, `WasteGraded`,
`IncentiveCreated`, `ParticipantRegistered`, `ChallengeCompleted`.

**Expiration** ♻  
The mechanism by which waste items become invalid after a configurable time-to-live (TTL).
Each waste type has an independent TTL set via `set_waste_ttl`; newly registered waste items
store their deadline in `expires_at`. Expired waste cannot be transferred.
See: [Waste Expiration System](./WASTE_STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md).

**Expert** 👤  
The highest `CertificationLevel` (201+ wastes processed). Earns a 1.5× reward multiplier.

**expires_at** ⛓ ♻

**Grade** ♻ 💰  
A quality classification (A, B, C, D) assigned to a waste item by a Collector or Manufacturer.
The grade influences the reward multiplier applied to the base incentive:

| Grade | Multiplier | Meaning          |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| A     | 1.5×       | Excellent quality |
| B     | 1.2×       | Good quality      |
| C     | 1.0×       | Average quality   |
| D     | 0.7×       | Poor quality      |

Default grade for newly submitted waste: **C**.
See: `WasteGrade` enum and `set_waste_grade` in the contract.

**Grade History** ⛓  
An immutable audit log of all grading events for a waste item, stored as `Vec<GradeRecord>`.
Retrievable via `get_grade_history(waste_id)`. Each record contains: `waste_id`, `grade`,
`grader` address, and `graded_at` timestamp.

**Grading Rules** ♻  
Per-waste-type minimum quality thresholds that define the lowest acceptable grade for recycling:

| Waste Type  | Min Grade | Reason |
