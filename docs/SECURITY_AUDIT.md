4. Manual review of critical functions
5. Threat modeling

---

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Critical Issues: 0 ✅

No critical vulnerabilities found.

### High Severity Issues: 0 ✅

No high severity vulnerabilities found.

### Medium Severity Issues: 2 ⚠️

#### 1. Potential Integer Overflow in Reward Calculation

**Location**: `distribute_rewards()` function  
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: MITIGATED

**Description**:
Reward calculation multiplies weight × incentive_points. With large values, could theoretically overflow.

**Code**:
```rust
let reward = waste.weight * incentive.reward_points;
```

**Mitigation**:
- Rust's checked arithmetic catches overflows
- Maximum weight: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 kg (u128)
- Maximum points: 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (u128)
- Practical limits prevent overflow

**Recommendation**: ✅ ACCEPTED - Current implementation is safe

---

#### 2. Percentage Calculation Precision

**Location**: `distribute_rewards()` function  
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: MITIGATED

**Description**:
Percentage-based reward splits may lose precision with rounding.

**Code**:
```rust
let collector_reward = (reward * collector_pct) / 100;
let owner_reward = reward - collector_reward;
```

**Mitigation**:
- Owner receives remainder (prevents loss)
- Percentages must sum to 100
- Rounding favors owner (incentive alignment)

**Recommendation**: ✅ ACCEPTED - Current implementation is fair

---

### Low Severity Issues: 3 ℹ️

#### 1. Missing Event for Admin Transfer

**Location**: `transfer_admin()` function  
**Severity**: LOW  
**Status**: RECOMMENDED

**Description**:
Admin transfer doesn't emit event for audit trail.

**Recommendation**:
```rust
env.events().publish(
    ("admin", "transferred"),
    (old_admin, new_admin),
);
```

**Impact**: Improves auditability

---

#### 2. No Expiration for Incentives

**Location**: Incentive management  
**Severity**: LOW  
**Status**: RECOMMENDED

**Description**:
Incentives don't have expiration dates, could remain active indefinitely.

**Recommendation**:
Add optional `expires_at` field to Incentive struct.

**Impact**: Better incentive lifecycle management

---

#### 3. Batch Operation Size Limit

**Location**: `submit_materials_batch()` function  
**Severity**: LOW  
**Status**: RECOMMENDED

**Description**:
No limit on batch size could cause gas exhaustion.

**Recommendation**:
```rust
if materials.len() > 100 {
    return Err(Error::BatchTooLarge);
}
```

**Impact**: Prevents DoS attacks

## Threat Model Analysis

### Threat 1: Unauthorized Admin Access

**Threat**: Attacker gains admin privileges

**Mitigation**:
- Admin set once at initialization
- Transfer requires current admin signature
- No backdoors or default credentials

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

---

### Threat 2: Waste Ownership Spoofing

**Threat**: User claims ownership of waste they didn't submit

**Mitigation**:
- Ownership verified at submission
- Only owner can transfer
- Transfer creates immutable record

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

---

### Threat 3: Reward Manipulation

**Threat**: Attacker manipulates reward calculations

**Mitigation**:
- Calculations use checked arithmetic
- Percentages validated
- Budget tracking prevents overspending
- Immutable incentive records

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

---

### Threat 4: Double Spending

**Threat**: Waste transferred twice simultaneously

**Mitigation**:
- Stellar blockchain ensures atomicity
- Only one owner at a time
- Transfer creates new record

**Risk Level**: 🟢 LOW

---

### Threat 5: Denial of Service

**Threat**: Attacker floods contract with requests

**Mitigation**:
- Stellar network rate limiting
- Batch size limits (recommended)
- Gas costs prevent spam

**Risk Level**: 🟡 MEDIUM (mitigated by recommendations)
