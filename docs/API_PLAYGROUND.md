# API Playground

The Scavenger API Playground is an in-browser REST client for exploring and testing all backend endpoints without leaving the app.

## Accessing the Playground

Navigate to `/playground` in the Scavenger web app. No additional installation is required.

For local development:

```
http://localhost:3000/playground
```

The playground reads `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at build time. To target a different environment, set that variable before building:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.staging.scavenger.io npm run build
```

---

## Interface Overview

The playground is split into three areas:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Left panel** | Toggle between *Examples* (pre-built requests) and *History* (past requests) |
| **Request builder** | Method selector, URL bar, Send button, and tabs for Params / Headers / Body / Auth |
| **Response viewer** | Status, duration, response body (pretty-printed JSON), and response headers |

---

## Building a Request

### 1. Method and URL

Select an HTTP method from the dropdown (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) and type or paste the endpoint path:

```
GET  /api/contracts/wastes
```

The base URL (`http://localhost:8080` or `VITE_API_BASE_URL`) is prepended automatically.

### 2. Query Parameters

Switch to the **Params** tab to add URL query parameters as key-value pairs. Enable or disable individual parameters using the checkbox. Enabled parameters are appended to the URL automatically.

Example:

| Key | Value | Enabled |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `page` | `1` | ✅ |
| `limit` | `20` | ✅ |
| `status` | `pending` | ✅ |

### 3. Headers

Switch to the **Headers** tab to add or modify request headers. The `Accept: application/json` header is pre-populated for new requests.

Custom headers required by the backend:

| Header | When Required |
|--------|--------------|
| `Content-Type: application/json` | POST / PUT / PATCH with JSON body |
| `X-CSRF-Token: <token>` | All mutating requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) |
| `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Authenticated endpoints |

### 4. Request Body

Switch to the **Body** tab to write a JSON (or other format) request body. A warning is shown when a body is provided with `GET` or `DELETE`.

Example body for `/api/export`:

```json
{
  "format": "csv",
  "data_type": "wastes",
  "anonymize": false
}
```

### 5. Authentication

Switch to the **Auth** tab to configure credentials. The playground supports four modes:

| Mode | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **None** | No authentication header added |
| **Bearer Token** | Adds `Authorization: Bearer <token>` |
| **API Key** | Adds `X-API-Key: <key>` |
| **Stellar Public Key** | Adds `X-Stellar-Public-Key: <key>` |

Credentials are stored only in component state — they are never persisted to `localStorage` or sent to any analytics service.

---

## Example Requests

The playground ships with six pre-built example requests covering common workflows. Select a category tab and click **Load** to populate the request builder.

| Category | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| Contracts | List Wastes | Paginated list of waste records |
| Contracts | Get Contract Stats | Overall on-chain statistics |
| Analytics | Get Analytics | Participant analytics with date filtering |
| Export | Export CSV | Export waste data as a CSV file |
| Audit | Get Audit Logs | Retrieve paginated audit log entries |
| Verification | Verify Record | Submit a record for verification |

---

## Request History

Every request you send is stored in the **History** panel for the current session. Click any entry to reload that request and its response into the builder and viewer.

History is stored in React state only — it is cleared when the page is refreshed.

Use cases:
- Replay a request with modified parameters
- Compare responses across different environments
- Debug intermittent failures by replaying exact request payloads

---

## Response Visualization

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Status badge | HTTP status code with colour coding (green = 2xx, amber = 3xx/4xx, red = 5xx) |
| Duration | Round-trip time in milliseconds |
| Timestamp | Local time when the response was received |
| Body | JSON responses are pretty-printed automatically; other formats shown verbatim |
| Headers | Full response header table |
| Copy button | Copies the pretty-printed body to the clipboard |

---

## Error Responses

All errors from the Scavenger backend follow the unified error format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "validation.field_error",
    "message": "Field 'email': required",
    "status": 422,
    "category": "validation",
    "fields": [
      { "field": "email", "message": "required" }
    ]
  }
}
```

See [Error Codes Reference](./ERROR_CODES.md) for the full list of codes.

## Common Workflows

### Register a Participant

```
POST /api/contracts/participants
Content-Type: application/json
X-CSRF-Token: <token>

{
  "name": "EcoRecyclers Ltd",
  "role": "recycler",
  "location": "Lagos, NG"
}
```

### Submit and Confirm a Waste Record

```
POST /api/contracts/wastes
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "waste_type": "plastic",
  "weight": 5000,
  "location": "6.5244,3.3792"
}
```

Then confirm:

```
POST /api/contracts/wastes/{id}/confirm
X-CSRF-Token: <token>
```

### Export Audit Data as JSON

```
POST /api/export
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "format": "json",
  "data_type": "audit_logs",
  "anonymize": true
}
```

---

## Rate Limits

The backend enforces the following limits. The playground respects them:

| Tier | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Default | 100 requests / minute |
| Burst | 10 requests / second |

When the rate limit is exceeded you will see:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "rate_limit.exceeded", "status": 429, ... } }
```

Wait for the `X-RateLimit-Reset` response header timestamp before retrying.

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + Enter` / `Cmd + Enter` | Send the current request |
| `Ctrl + L` | Focus the URL bar |
| `Escape` | Cancel an in-flight request (if supported by browser) |
