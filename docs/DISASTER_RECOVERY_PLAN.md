# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive disaster recovery procedures for the Scavenger platform, including backup strategies, recovery procedures, and incident response runbooks.

## Recovery Objectives

### RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
- **Critical Services**: 15 minutes
- **Database**: 30 minutes
- **Full System**: 1 hour

### RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
- **Database**: 5 minutes (continuous replication)
- **Application State**: 15 minutes (automated backups)
- **Configuration**: Real-time (version controlled)

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups
- **Frequency**: Continuous streaming replication + hourly snapshots
- **Retention**: 30 days for hourly, 90 days for daily
- **Location**: Primary region + cross-region replicas
- **Verification**: Automated restore tests weekly

### Application Backups
- **Container Images**: Stored in ECR with multi-region replication
- **Configuration**: Version controlled in Git
- **Secrets**: Encrypted in AWS Secrets Manager with cross-region replication

### Backup Verification
```bash
# Weekly backup restoration test
0 2 * * 0 /scripts/verify-backup-restore.sh

# Monthly full DR drill
0 3 1 * * /scripts/full-dr-drill.sh
```

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery
1. Identify failure point from CloudWatch logs
2. Promote read replica to primary (< 2 minutes)
3. Update application connection strings
4. Verify data consistency
5. Monitor replication lag

### Application Recovery
1. Trigger auto-scaling to replace failed instances
2. Verify health checks pass
3. Monitor error rates and latency
4. Rollback if issues detected

### Multi-Region Failover
1. Detect primary region failure (health check timeout)
2. Update Route53 to secondary region
3. Promote secondary database to primary
4. Verify all services operational
5. Initiate incident communication

## Incident Runbooks

### Database Failure
**Detection**: CloudWatch alarm on replication lag > 5 minutes
**Response Time**: < 5 minutes
1. Check primary database status
2. Verify network connectivity
3. Promote read replica if primary unrecoverable
4. Update DNS records
5. Notify team

### Application Crash
**Detection**: Health check failures > 3 consecutive
**Response Time**: < 2 minutes
1. Check application logs
2. Trigger pod restart
3. Scale up if resource constrained
4. Verify recovery
5. Post-incident review

### Data Corruption
**Detection**: Data validation checks
**Response Time**: < 30 minutes
1. Isolate affected data
2. Restore from backup
3. Verify data integrity
4. Resume operations
5. Root cause analysis

## DR Drill Schedule

- **Monthly**: Full system failover test
- **Quarterly**: Cross-region failover test
- **Annually**: Complete disaster scenario simulation

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Replication lag (target: < 1 second)
- Backup completion time (target: < 5 minutes)
- Recovery time (target: < 15 minutes)
- Data consistency checks (target: 100% pass)

### Alert Thresholds
- Replication lag > 5 minutes: Critical
- Backup failure: Critical
- Health check failures > 3: Warning
- Disk usage > 80%: Warning

## Communication Plan

### Escalation Path
1. On-call engineer (immediate)
2. Team lead (5 minutes)
3. Engineering manager (15 minutes)
4. VP Engineering (30 minutes)

### Status Updates
- Every 15 minutes during incident
- Post-incident report within 24 hours
- Root cause analysis within 48 hours
