## Getting Started

### What is Scavngr?

Scavngr is a decentralised recycling platform on the Stellar blockchain. It connects three types of participants in a transparent supply chain:

- **Recyclers** — collect waste materials and submit them to the platform
- **Collectors** — receive, sort, and verify materials from recyclers
- **Manufacturers** — process verified materials and reward the supply chain

Every action — registration, submission, transfer, reward — is recorded on-chain, making the entire lifecycle transparent and auditable.

### What You Need

## Waste Submission Guide

Recyclers submit waste items to start the supply chain. Each submission records the type, weight, and location of the material.

### Accepted Waste Types

| Type | Examples | Points per kg (base) |
|---|---|---|
| 🧴 **Plastic** | Bottles, containers, packaging | 2 |
| 📰 **Paper** | Cardboard, newspapers, office paper | 1 |
| 🔩 **Metal** | Aluminium cans, steel, copper wire | 5 |
| 🍶 **Glass** | Bottles, jars, containers | 2 |
| 🌿 **Organic** | Food scraps, garden waste | 1 |
| 💻 **Electronic** | Phones, computers, batteries | 6 |

### Single Waste Submission

1. Navigate to **Submit Waste** or click **+ New Submission**
2. Select the **Waste Type** from the dropdown
3. Enter the **Weight** in grams (minimum 100 g)
4. Set your **Location**:
   - Click **Use My Location** to auto-fill from your browser
   - Or enter latitude/longitude manually
5. Add an optional **description** (e.g. "10 plastic bottles from office")
6. Click **Submit** and approve in Freighter

**Transaction cost**: ~1 XLM

### Batch Submission

Submit multiple waste items in a single transaction (more efficient, lower fees):

1. Click **Batch Submit**
2. Click **+ Add Item** for each waste item
3. For each item, select type and enter weight
4. Click **Submit All** and approve in Freighter

**Transaction cost**: ~2 XLM (cheaper than submitting individually)

### Tracking Your Submissions

After submitting:
- View all your waste in **My Waste** dashboard
- Each item shows current status:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | Awaiting verification by a collector |
| **Verified** | Confirmed by a collector |
| **Transferred** | Moved to another participant |
| **Deactivated** | Removed from active circulation |

### Transferring Waste to a Collector

Once your waste is submitted, you can transfer it to a registered collector:

1. Go to **My Waste** and select a waste item
2. Click **Transfer**
3. Enter the collector's Stellar address (must be a registered Collector)
4. Add an optional transfer note
5. Confirm your current location
6. Click **Transfer** and approve in Freighter

> Only the current owner of a waste item can initiate a transfer.

---

## Verification Guide

Collectors verify waste to confirm its quality and type before it moves further in the supply chain.

### Why Verification Matters

Verification is the quality gate of the supply chain:
- Ensures reported weights and types are accurate
- Triggers reward eligibility
- Creates an auditable chain of custody

### Verifying a Waste Item (Collectors only)

1. Waste transferred to you appears in **Pending Verification**
2. Click on a waste item to view its details:
   - Type, weight, submission location
   - Submitter's address and history
3. Physically inspect the material to confirm it matches the submission
4. Click **Verify** and approve in Freighter

> ⚠️ Only verify waste you have physically inspected. False verifications undermine the platform's integrity.

**Transaction cost**: ~0.5 XLM

### Confirming Waste Details

After verification, use **Confirm Details** to formally attest:
- Waste type matches submission
- Weight is within acceptable tolerance
- Material is not contaminated

### Resetting Confirmation

If you need to correct a confirmation:
1. Go to the waste item in **My Inventory**
2. Click **Reset Confirmation**
3. Approve in Freighter (only the waste owner can do this)

---

## Incentive Guide

Manufacturers create incentive programmes to encourage collection of specific materials by offering reward points.

### How Incentives Work

```
Manufacturer creates incentive:
  Waste type: Plastic
  Reward: 100 points per kg
  Budget: 10,000 points total

Recycler submits 5 kg plastic → earns 500 points
Collector receives 30% → 150 points
Recycler receives 70% → 350 points
Budget remaining: 9,500 points
```

### Creating an Incentive (Manufacturers only)

1. Navigate to **Incentives → Create Incentive**
2. Fill in the form:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Waste Type | Which material you want to incentivise |
| Reward Points | Points per kilogram |
| Total Budget | Maximum total points available |

3. Click **Create** and approve in Freighter

**Transaction cost**: ~1 XLM

### Managing Your Incentives

In **Incentives → My Incentives** you can:

- **View** remaining budget and points per unit
- **Update** reward rate or add budget (click **Edit**)
- **Deactivate** an incentive that has met its goals (click **Deactivate**)

> Once an incentive's budget reaches zero, it auto-deactivates.

### Distributing Rewards

After receiving verified materials from the supply chain:

1. Go to **Reward Distribution**
2. Select the waste item and matching incentive
3. Review the distribution:
   - Recycler share (default: 70%)
   - Collector share (default: 30%)
4. Click **Distribute Rewards** and approve in Freighter

The reward points are immediately credited to each participant's account.

### Tiered Incentives

Some incentives offer higher rates for larger quantities:

| Weight Range | Points per kg |
|---|---|
| 0–10 kg | 50 |
| 10–100 kg | 75 |
| 100+ kg | 100 |

Check the incentive details page to see if tiers apply.

## Analytics Guide

Track your environmental impact and platform activity from your personal dashboard.

### Your Dashboard

Access your dashboard at **Account → Dashboard**. It shows:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Total Waste Processed** | Cumulative grams you've submitted or handled |
| **Total Tokens Earned** | Lifetime reward points accumulated |
| **Active Groups** | Number of supply chain groups you're part of |
| **Certification Level** | Your tier based on activity (Beginner → Expert) |

### Certification Levels

Your certification level upgrades automatically as you process more waste:

| Level | Waste Processed | Reward Multiplier |
|---|---|---|
| 🌱 Beginner | 0–10 items | 1.0× |
| 🌿 Intermediate | 11–50 items | 1.1× |
| 🌳 Advanced | 51–200 items | 1.25× |
| ⭐ Expert | 201+ items | 1.5× |

### Supply Chain Statistics

The **Analytics** page shows platform-wide data:

- Total waste processed by type (chart)
- Top contributors leaderboard
- Active incentives by waste type
- Supply chain throughput over time

### Carbon Credits

Each waste type has a CO₂ offset rate. The platform calculates your total carbon impact:

| Waste Type | CO₂ offset rate |
|---|---|
| Plastic | 2.5 g CO₂e per gram |
| Paper | 1.8 g CO₂e per gram |
| Metal | 3.2 g CO₂e per gram |

## Troubleshooting FAQs

### Wallet & Connection

**Q: My wallet won't connect.**
A: (1) Ensure Freighter is installed and unlocked. (2) Refresh the page. (3) Check you're on the correct network (testnet vs mainnet) in Freighter settings. (4) Try a different browser.

**Q: The "Connect Wallet" button does nothing.**
A: (1) Check your browser's popup blocker isn't preventing the Freighter window. (2) Try disabling other wallet extensions. (3) Clear browser cache.

**Q: I see "Transaction Failed" after approving.**
A: (1) Check your XLM balance — you need at least 1 XLM for fees. (2) Verify you're on the correct Stellar network. (3) Retry after 30 seconds (temporary congestion). (4) Check the error code in Freighter's transaction history.

---

### Registration

**Q: I get "Participant already registered."**
A: Each Stellar address can only register once. If you used a different account, connect that wallet instead. If this is your first time, contact support.

**Q: My coordinates are rejected.**
A: Latitude must be −90 to +90, longitude −180 to +180, entered as decimal degrees (e.g. 52.52, not 52°31'). Use the map picker for accuracy.

**Q: Can I change my role?**
A: Yes — go to **Account → Settings → Update Role**. Note: changing roles resets some statistics.

---

### Waste Submission

**Q: "Weight must be at least 100 grams."**
A: The minimum submission is 100 g. Combine smaller amounts into a single submission.

**Q: "Weight exceeds maximum."**
A: Split large batches into multiple submissions (max 1,000,000 kg per submission). Use batch submission for efficiency.

**Q: My submitted waste doesn't appear in My Waste.**
A: Wait 10–15 seconds for blockchain confirmation. If it still doesn't appear, check the transaction in Stellar Expert using the transaction hash from Freighter.

---

### Verification & Transfers

**Q: I can't verify waste.**
A: (1) Ensure you're registered as a Collector. (2) The waste must be transferred to you first. (3) You cannot verify waste you submitted yourself.

**Q: "Cannot transfer — not owner."**
A: Only the current owner can transfer waste. If you received it from a transfer, you are now the owner and can transfer it onward.

---

### Rewards

**Q: I submitted waste but received no rewards.**
A: Rewards are distributed by the manufacturer after the waste reaches them and they call **Distribute Rewards**. Contact the manufacturer if distribution is delayed.

**Q: My reward amount seems lower than expected.**
A: (1) Check the incentive's points per kg. (2) Verify your waste weight was accepted. (3) Note that collectors receive 30% — if you're a collector, you get 30% of the incentive value, not 100%.

**Q: The incentive says "budget exhausted."**
A: The manufacturer's budget ran out. They need to create a new incentive or add budget to the existing one.
